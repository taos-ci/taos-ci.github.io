Also, we provide the goto_repodir() to go to a git repository folder as a work folder.\nFirst, open ./config/config-plugins-{prebuild|postbuild}.sh. Then, append a function name of a module that you want to attach newly. If you are poor at CI module, we recommend that you refer to the existing examples.\nSecond, if you have to install a debian package additionally for a new module, please modify the install-package-base.sh file. In this case, we assume that you have to install the shellcheck debian package.\nFinally, please describe the goal of the module at the below wiki page.\nFirst of all, Note that you have to run the below statement in order to check the grammar error of a CI module that your write.\nWhen you submit a pull request to merge your CI module to TAOS-CI repository, Please note that reviewers check 4 requirements as follows before merging your pull request.\n\n\nplugins-base: it is a well-maintained collection of CI plugins. A wide rang of Tizen (gbs) and Ubuntu (pdebuild) are included.\n\nplugins-good: it is a set of plug-ins that we consider to have good quality code, correct functionality, our preferred license (Apache for the plug-in code).\n\nplugins-staging: it is a set of plug-ins that are not up to par compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they are missing something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, or aging test.\n\n\ncibot_comment(): This API write a requested message into a webpage of issue number or PR number.\ncibot_report(): The API update the current status of the context of the module.\ngoto_repodir(): This API is to change a folder location from a current directory to a git repository directory.\ncheck_cmd_dep(): This API is to check if required commands are installed in the server.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/nnsuite/TAOS-CI/wiki/TAOS-CI-Plug-in-Modules\n\n\nMaintenance: The module has to be normally executed as a CI component after enabling the module via a configuration file.\nReadability: Most of the developer should be able to read the source code of the new module.\nExecution time: The time required to execute the module should not be long.\nCompatibility: The module should be able to run on Ubuntu distribution by default.\n\n"});
