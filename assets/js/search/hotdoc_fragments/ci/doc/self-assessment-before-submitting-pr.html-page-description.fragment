To do source code verification,\nwe strongly recommend that you execute a clean build with a latest version of a software platform.\nNote that partial validation inspection of software cause potential defects when the software is\nintegrated into the software platform.\nYou have to execute pdebuild command before submitting your PR.\nYou have to execute gbs build command before submitting your PR.\nWe assume that your work folder is /var/www/html/poky_sdk folder. Note that 'devtool' command is located in Yocto SDK folder.\nThe source code below is an example in case that you have to write helloYocto source code in your own github repository.\nYocto provides three build methods to compile a source code as following:\n\nCMake-based hello-world project (Recommended)\n\n\nMakefile-based hello-world project\n\n\nAutotool-based hello-world project\nPlease refer to https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.1/sdk-manual/sdk-manual.html#autotools-based-projects.\n\n"});
